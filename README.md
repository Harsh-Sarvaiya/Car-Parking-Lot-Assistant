### Introduction ✍️
#### ~~~~~~~~~~~~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parking lots – in general – must be designed to optimize space and ease of use. To maximize space for allotted parking spots, parking lots are made in rectangular shaped land such as ours. For ease of use, the parking spots closest to the exit are reserved for people with disabilities and/or pregnant mothers. Our design requires a one way lane in the shape of a U, with parking spots empty on both sides. While adhering to the required city and provincial guidelines, parking lots need to be built with slight downward angles, such that any rain and slush flows into storm drains. Due to snowtime conditions, parking lots also need snow pile storage locations that are out of the way of the cars, yet also accessible for workers to pave snow into. Our design has a specific location for snow storage near the sides of the “U.” Furthermore, to improve ease of access for customers, pedestrian walkways will be constructed on the outside edge of the “U,” allowing ample walking space and easy access to nearby stores or malls. Our design will have an ultrasonic sensor which will detect cars entering or leaving the lot, along with an LCD screen which displays the number of available parking spots.
